# Motivation
 I wanted to build a project that would give me full access to my workout data and allow me to use it measure progress in the gym as well as other interesting statistics.\
 Hevy currently limits free users by only allowing them to see data for the past 3 months. By utilizing Hevy's hidden API, this web application is capable of downloading all of a user's data for further use.\
